❓ YOUR QUESTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"With the QR code method (software-only), how do I disconnect 
 users when their WiFi time expires?"

📡 YOUR ROUTER: TP-Link ER7206 (Professional Multi-WAN Router)


⚡ QUICK ANSWER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

GOOD NEWS! The TP-Link ER7206 is a PROFESSIONAL router with advanced
features including:
✅ Captive Portal support (via Omada Controller)

TWO PATHS AVAILABLE:

PATH 1: Software-only (QR code method)
❌ Cannot physically disconnect users
✅ Enhanced portal with countdown timer (70-80% compliance)

PATH 2: Omada Controller Integration (Recommended!)

✅ Full captive portal with time limits
✅ Professional guest management
✅ Automatic session termination

Done! Your users will now see countdown timers! ⏱️


💡 WHAT USERS SEE NOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BEFORE (Basic Portal):
  ✅ Connected!
  [Close Window]
  
  → User has NO IDEA when it expires
  → Likely stays connected past time limit

AFTER (Enhanced Portal):
  ✅ Connected!
  
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ Time Remaining      │
  │                     │
  │    [ 47m 23s ]      │
  │  ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░       │
  └─────────────────────┘
  
  → User sees EXACT time remaining
  → Gets warning at 5 minutes
  → Sees "Expired" screen when done
  → Much more likely to disconnect on time


⚠️ WHAT IT CAN'T DO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ Physically disconnect users from WiFi
❌ Block their network access
❌ Control the router
❌ Force disconnection

WHY? Software-only solution has no network control.


✅ WHAT IT DOES DO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Shows countdown timer
✅ Validates session every 60 seconds
✅ Warns at 5 minutes remaining
✅ Shows "Session Expired" screen
✅ Significantly improves user awareness
✅ Better compliance (70-80% vs 20-30%)
✅ Professional appearance
✅ FREE!
