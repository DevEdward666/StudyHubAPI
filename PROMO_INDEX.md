```http
POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/promos/create
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "WELCOME20",

## 🔍 Validation Rules

The system automatically validates every promo:

1. **Status Check** → Must be "Active"
2. **Date Range** → Must be within startDate and endDate
3. **Minimum Purchase** → Must meet minPurchaseAmount
4. **Total Usage Limit** → Must not exceed usageLimit
5. **Per-User Limit** → Must not exceed usagePerUser for this user
6. **Maximum Discount** → Bonus capped at maxDiscountAmount

---

## 📈 Statistics Tracking

Each promo automatically tracks:
- **Total Usage Count** - How many times used
- **Unique Users** - Number of different users
- **Total Bonus Given** - Sum of all bonus credits
- **Total Purchase Amount** - Sum of all purchases
- **Last Used At** - Most recent usage timestamp

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### 1. Use the HTTP Test File
Open `test-promos.http` in your editor (requires REST Client extension)

### 2. Get Admin Token
Login as admin to get JWT token

### 3. Run Tests
Execute the test requests in order:
1. Create percentage promo
2. Create fixed amount promo
3. Create buy-x-get-y promo
4. Get all promos
5. Validate promo as user
6. Check statistics

### 4. Verify Database
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U your_username -d your_database

# Check promos table
SELECT code, name, type, status FROM promos;

# Check usage
SELECT * FROM promo_usages;
```

---

## 🔄 Integration Workflow

### Option A: Manual Application (Current)
1. User submits purchase request
2. Admin views pending transactions
3. Admin validates promo code (optional)
4. Admin applies promo when approving
5. User gets purchase + bonus credits
6. Usage is tracked automatically

### Option B: Automatic Application (Future)
1. User enters promo code during purchase
2. Frontend validates promo via API
3. System stores promo with transaction
4. When admin approves, bonus auto-applies
5. User gets purchase + bonus credits
