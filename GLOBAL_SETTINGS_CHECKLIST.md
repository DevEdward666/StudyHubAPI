## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd Study-Hub

# Ensure migrations are up to date
dotnet ef database update

# Build and run
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd study_hub_app

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy dist folder to your hosting
# (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3, etc.)
```

### 3. Initial Setup
After deployment:
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to Global Settings
3. Create initial settings:
   - payment.fixed_rate
   - feature.wifi_portal_enabled
   - feature.promo_codes_enabled
   - system.session_timeout_minutes
   - notification.email_enabled

### 4. Verification

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations
- No bulk edit feature (planned for future)
- No setting deletion from UI (use API directly)

- No setting templates
- No rollback feature from UI
- History is append-only (no edit/delete)

### Workarounds
- Bulk operations: Use API directly or script
- Setting deletion: Use Swagger UI or API client
- Export: Query database directly
- Import: Use script with API calls

- [x] Search and filter functional
- [x] History tracking working
- [x] No security vulnerabilities
